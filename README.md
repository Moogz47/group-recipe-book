# group-recipe-book
Group Project for JavaScript course with members Julila Mpesha, Michael Newman, and Musa Jama.

The purpose of our website is to give families/ individuals dinner ideas that account for dietary restrictions, preferences, something new, or just ideas that they can tweak based on what they have available to them. 
A big problem in households is the dinner planning for the week/ day. Instead of going to the nearest fast food chain for convenience our options will be from 10 min meals to 45 min+ which in most cases would be the distance to the nearest restaurant without the expensive price tag.
Our website has a random button that will randomly select a recipe for the indecisive users.
Our website is simple enough for everyday people.

Some of the main features of our website are:
A collapsible nav bar that helps guide the users around the page. We have sections on the different options they can look through i.e. main dish, sides, pairings (alcohol vs non), desserts. Our recipes are on cards that show a preview of the dish, and when flipped, they show the recipe of the selected card. At the top of the cards are disclaimers for if the recipe calls for any allergenic ingredient i.e. peanuts, fish, milk, etc.

The header of the website is the title of our website spanning across the top of the page. Underneath is a quick guide section, then a questionnaire form with radio buttons that will be saved for the next time they visit the website. The radio buttons will be for allergies and dietary restrictions with a submit and reset button that either saves the selected options or resets the selections. 
The nav bar is available by 3 lines at the top left of the page at all times. When expanded it will have the sections of the website listed so they can be selected, a random button, and a search bar.
Each section will have tiles that show an image of the dish and the name of the dish. Once flipped it will show the ingredients of the dish, the prep, and directions to make the food.
At the bottom of the page above the footer is the random button that will select a random dish.
